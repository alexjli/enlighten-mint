# enlighten-mint
HackMIT Project 2019

Enlighten-mint is an app designed to help you learn and remembers you encounter everyday.

Simply highlight the text, right click, and "Enlighten" it to see its definition and other relevant information about the word.

The words are then stored and can be accessed at anytime from the side panel. The side panel can be accessed by clicking the edge of the panel peaking out of the edge or clicking the "E" at the top right of your screen.
